<h1>Designer’s Notes</h1>
This game arose in a rather untoward fashion according to the conventional game design wisdom. It began as the quintessential Fantasy Heartbreaker. D&D is so awesome, except for this one thing! And this other thing! Be that as it may, I began to have ideas about game design that seemed to be slowly evolving past simple issues with D&D. They also weren’t quite addressed to my satisfaction in any game system I have encountered, despite a good deal of looking around.
My main interest is to explore a strategic kingdom building background to a fantasy roleplaying game. This has been done, of course, in games like Birthright, Pendragon, Reign, Houses of the Blooded, Song of Ice and Fire, Burning Empires, not to mention more recent supplements for games like 3E and Pathfinder (Kingmaker Campaign).
Although each of these games had elements I was interested in, none of them quite captured what I was hoping for. Houses of the Blooded, a game I actually read later in the design process, is probably the closest to what I was looking for, since it embraces the strategic vision I was interested in. But, there are a few unique elements I’m most interested in exploring under a single game system. They are:
<h2> Troupe Style Play</h2>
Rather than each player restricting themselves to a single character, a group of characters is used, and different characters selected for the mission at hand.
One benefit to this approach is that players usually have a character which is appropriate to the type of scene they’re in. No need to explain away taking a diplomat into a dungeon.
Another aspect of having the troupe style play is that heroes themselves become a resource. If enough of them are injured or not able to function, then certain types of missions become very difficult. This makes for interesting strategic choices.
The downside is that it can be difficult switching characters too often. In practice, since there is a limited pool of characters, a player will generally rotate between only a few characters.
<h2> Well defined missions</h2>
Another key part of the design is the use of missions with very transparent rewards and consequences.
A high level of transparency makes it easier to strategize which activities most naturally align with the vision of the Stronghold.
Setting the stakes of the missions ahead of time also can help increase tension during the mission.
Finally, restricting missions to a set of pre-defined types makes it possible to focus play towards a very specific task. Sometimes players can lose focus of their goal, possibly over-analyzing options. Setting the nature of the mission beforehand makes this less likely, as the task is openly discussed by both the players and the GM.
In a kingdom building game, some sort of high level structure seems necessary so that the temporal pacing makes sense. By having short constrained missions, which are tied to a season of time, the campaign is able to progress at a reasonable rate, without getting bogged down in too much minutiae.
The missions themselves are also constrained in terms of how different scenes fit together. This is done for pacing reasons, so that a particular mission fits into a reasonable length of time. It also allows for different mechanical elements (like mini-games) to fit into a session of play.
<h2> A marriage of mechanics and setting</h2>
I think it makes for better play if mechanics are adapted as closely as possible to the setting. There are certainly generic mechanics that are highly useful, as evidenced by the use of 
Fate in this game, but certain mechanics bring about different play styles and need to be adapted to the target genre. While generic toolkits are sometimes fun, it’s usually not trivial getting them to fit into a setting. I wanted to do as much of that heavy lifting as possible.
As such, a fantasy kingdom building game is probably best built from the ground up as a cohesive whole. I’m fairly skeptical of rule sets which attempt to tack on the mechanics of kingdom building to a framework which was never designed to support maintaining a kingdom. In such a game, the kingdom becomes simply a possession that a character has, rather than the focus of the game.
I think this should be extended to the setting. There are plenty of fantasy RPGs out there which throw all the standard tropes into a box and let the GM and players sort it out. That’s all well and good, but I’m more interested in giving the GM a world which is partially fleshed out, since it becomes much easier to control how the setting and the mechanics interact. Very frequently rules have implicit settings (such as D&D) – but it’s probably better to make the setting explicit to clarify exactly what sort of game works with the rules.
Finally, having a better defined setting makes it easier for GMs to construct missions quickly. Part of my goal with this game is to lower preparation time, without sacrificing interesting tactical options. This is possible only be essentially building the rules around a specific setting. While this is certainly not a simple game, it also isn’t a high prep game. These three principles have guided the design process. Certainly games exist which embrace some of these design goals. The three that are closest are probably: Houses of the Blooded, which does a great job of putting the kingdom at the forefront, with just the right amount of fiddliness, Diaspora, which explores the idea of using mini-games as tactically rich resolution systems, as well as being a Fate game, and finally Burning Empires, which uses scene currency very effectively. I’m sure those excellent games have influenced what I’ve tried to do with WotA. Editorial note: Specific skills, stunts, mission types, mini-games, and resources are all capitalized. Every other game specific term is left lower case. All game specific terms are bolded the first time they are used. Chapter and section titles are capitalized and italicized when they are used.
<h2> On Compels</h2>
I'm a big fan of giving players other ways to earn fate points beyond compels. Even good Fate GMs don’t always do a good job of keeping Fate points flowing, so I’ve employed a number of player facing methods to do this. The terminology for “enduring” an aspect comes from Chronica Fuedalis, which is also a Fate inspired medieval game.
This concept of a mechanical system from hindering aspects is also a big part of Cortex+, which lets the player gain Fate-like currency by using skills in a potentially negative way. It’s also nice in a game that has more tactical elements to have an easier mechanical way to get Fate points.
The other big differences are minor advantages (which go away after a turn) and the stress limit on the Attack action. Both of these were put in place to handle the more tactical Infiltration and Skirmish mini-games. Create Advantage creates an action inequality that is compounded if players can sit back and create advantages instead of engaging. Furthermore, having too much stress come out of one attack can make one vs. many battles fairly boring.
