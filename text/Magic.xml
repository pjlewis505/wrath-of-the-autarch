        <p1>Magic is the fusion of mana and the spellcaster&apos;s will, a process known as channeling. Mana is chaotic and omnipresent froce of energy, difficult to control but powerful. It is present everywhere, although in some locations, the untamed and exotic parts of the wilds, it is present in high enough concentration to be harnessed by magic users. Characters with high enough <skill>Lore</skill> may learn <term>Secrets</term>, complex and arcane procedures for channeling mana to produce all manner of fantastical effects.</p1> 
        <h1>Mana</h1> 
        <p1>Mana, for those with attuned channeling abilities, appears as shimmering bands of color, like a tinted hue laid out upon the land. Each region generates its own unique signature of mana, and capable channelers can detect the origin of mana that has been channeled by casters. It can be stored and bound in a wide variety of vessels, although this greatly weaks its potency, making it worthless for use in spells.</p1> 
        <h2>Binding to the Land</h2> 
        <p1>Before wielding Secrets, a spellcaster must <term>bind</term> to the land. This is an involved process, taking an entire season to accomplish (newly made characters may start play already bound to a region). This is also a solitary time, as the caster takes solace in understanding the flore and fauna of the region. The caster becomes part of the land, in an intimate relationship. The caster will be acutely aware of when the land is damaged or when another caster is attempting to bind to the same region.</p1> 
        <p1>The regions with the highest amount of mana allow for the most potent use of magic. When a caster binds to a region, the region is noted on the character sheet, next to the character’s mana pool. It isn’t possible for a channeler to bind to more than one region, as the effort required to create bonds with the land is too great. A caster may change which region they are bound to, but this takes an entire season of time (no training or healing is possible).</p1> 
        <h2>Starting Mana</h2> 
        <p1>At the start of each season, every character bound to the land gains an amount of mana equal to their Channeling skill times the mana value of the region divided by two (as usual, round any fractions down).</p1> 
        <example>Kara is bound to the Sunset Isles. The Sunset Isles have two mana, along with a Mana Forge (increasing mana there by one for channeling). Kara’s Channeling skill is four. She will start each season with 4 * 3 = 12 / 2 = 6 mana.</example> 
        <h1>Wielding Magic</h1> 
        <p1>In order to use magic, a character needs to be bound to a region and have a high enough <skill>Lore</skill> skill to gain access to a Secret. Mana is then expended based on the specific Secret and effect desired, as outlined below.</p1> 
        <h2>Secrets</h2> 
        <p1>Secrets are groupings of thematically linked stunts. Each Secret has four stunts, the four tiers of increasing mystical knowledge with the Secret. These tiers, in order of increasing power, are known as <term>Initiate</term>, <term>Apprentice</term>, <term>Journeyman</term>, and <term>Keeper</term>. Earlier tiered stunts are prerequisites for later tiered stunts. For instance, a character must have the Apprentice level stunt in the Secret of the Elements (Hailstorm) before being able to gain the Journeyman Secret of the Elements stunt (Wind Rider). Casting a spell is the process of spending mana to use one of these stunts.</p1> 
        <p1>Although it&apos;s possible to become an Initiate in multiple Secrets, thus gaining broad ability, the only way to gain access to the very powerful Keeper stunts is to specialize. Specialists tend to be defined by their Secret. Each Secret tends to be linked with a worldview and ethos that is a core part of the caster.</p1> 
        <h3>Initiate Tier</h3> 
        <p1>All of the Initiate stunts are very similar mechanically. By spending a point of mana, the caster&apos;s <skill>Lore</skill> skill can be used in place of another skill in certain contexts. Each additional mana spent functions as a Fate point for the roll, except that no aspect need to be invoked. This allows for the potential to spend lots of mana to get a large bonus on the roll. However, the more mana spent, the greater the chance for backlash (see below).</p1> 
        <example>Kara is an Initiate in the Secret of the Elements. She is attacked by wolves, and spends one point of mana to use her Fire Blast stunt to allow her Lore skill to function as Marksmanship while attacking. She makes an opposed roll against the wolves&apos; Athletics, deciding to spend another two mana to add four to the roll. Three total mana is spent for the spell, which comes into play for backlash checks.</example> 
        <h3>Advanced Tiers</h3> 
        <p1>The stunt effects for the advanced tiers are all very different, although the mana costs are the same across tiers. It costs 5 mana to cast an Apprentice spell, 10 mana for a Journeyman spell, and 15 mana for a Keeper spell. The Keeper tier spells are tremendously powerful and can function as the capstone to an entire Stronghold strategy.</p1> 
        <h2>Backlash Check</h2> 
        <p1>Spending too much mana could result in a terrible <term>backlash</term> to the land the caster is bound to. Any time a character spends more mana than their Channeling skill the player rolls Channeling, opposed by the amount of mana spent. This is called the backlash check. Fate points or free invokes may not be spent to alter the check! Casting powerful spells is always risky.</p1> 
        <h2>Backlash Effects</h2> 
        <p1>The psychic link between the caster and the land flows both ways. For each point below the target number on the backlash check, one resource (food, timber, ore, mana, or luxuries) is permanently removed from the land the caster is bound to, chosen by the caster. Also, the region where the mana came from may becomes changed; taking on features which are related to the effect produced which caused the mana drain. The Autarch player gives the region a thematically appropriate aspect with one free invoke (or adds a free invoke if there&apos;s already an aspect from backlash). For example, the region might gain <aspect>Restless Spirits</aspect> if there is backlash from casting a Secret of the Dead. Choose wisely the lands where you draw mana from, as a region with no resources isn’t very valuable!</p1> 
        <h1>Secrets of the Dead</h1> 
        <p1>The white ships which sail to the island of the dead usually make no return trips. The mystics who know the Secrets of the Dead can voyage into that other dimension and pull the dead back, whether they want to return or not. Not a practice that most people would look upon favorably, sorcerers who master the Secrets of the Dead are frequently greeted with suspicion by many societies within the Realm.</p1> 
        <stuntt>Shadow Walker</stuntt> 
        <stuntp>1+ Mana</stuntp> 
        <stuntd>The caster phases into the realm of the dead, becoming shadowy and difficult to detect. Spend a point of mana to use <skill>Lore</skill> in place of the <skill>Stealth</skill> when moving quietly or hiding. Additional mana may be spent as Fate points to modify the roll.</stuntd> 
        <stuntt>Commune with the Dead</stuntt> 
        <stuntp>5 Mana</stuntp> 
        <stuntd>The caster contacts someone deceased, absorbing their thoughts and learning their secrets. The caster must know something about the target, if only descriptions gleaned from talking with others. Create a mission aspect with three free invokes that reflects the knowledge so gained. For instance, <fate>3</fate>
            <aspect>Intimate Knowledge of the History of Blackfell Keep</aspect>.</stuntd> 
        <stuntt>Animate Dead</stuntt> 
        <stuntp>10 Mana</stuntp> 
        <stuntd>A dead character is brought back as an undead thrall of the caster. The dead character retains most of their faculties they had while living, although they aren&apos;t quite the same mentally or physically. All of their skills are lowered by one and they lose access to all of their stunts. Stress tracks and consequences remain the same. Furthermore, two of their aspects are swapped out for new aspects chosen by The Autarch player. If they didn&apos;t have two aspects while living, they have two new aspects.</stuntd> 
        <stuntd>Undead minions follow the rules for minions and familiars laid out in the <chapref>Characters</chapref> chapter. Only one undead minion may be employed at a time.</stuntd> 
        <stuntt>Army of the Dead</stuntt> 
        <stuntp>15 Mana</stuntp> 
        <stuntd>The caster resurrects a well trained army from history. The army of the dead operate as five infantry, although only the caster may lead them in war. The army requires no food or water, so no resources must be expended to bring them into battle or keep them up. (See the <chapref>Warfare</chapref> chapter for more details on how to interpret the unit stat block. None of the developments apply to the army of the dead. If not destroyed in battle, the army crumbles at the end of the season in which it was summoned.</stuntd>

        <h1>Secrets of the Elements</h1> 
        <p1>Mastering the elements requires a keen eye for detail. Elemental magic is primarily used for its offensive capabilities, and is well suited to Skirmish and Warfare.</p1> 
        <stuntt>Fire Strike</stuntt> 
        <stuntp>1+ Mana</stuntp> 
        <stuntd>The caster harnesses fire, throwing it at a target. Spend a point of mana to use <skill>Lore</skill> in place of the <skill>Marksmanship</skill> to attack a target with fire. Additional mana may be spent as Fate points to modify the roll.</stuntd> 
        <stuntt>Hailstorm</stuntt> 
        <stuntp>5+ Mana</stuntp> 
        <stuntd>Large icy pellets fall from the sky. This works similarly to the <stunt>Fire Strike</stunt> stunt, except every target within the same zone is hit. Also, the target zone gets the <aspect>Icy Terrain</aspect> aspect with one free invoke. Additional mana beyond the five may be spent as Fate points to modify the roll.</stuntd>

        <h1>Secrets of the Wilds</h1> 
        <p1>Those who learn the Secrets of the Wild tend to become boorish, losing their way in polite society. They feel more at home amongst the beasts of the world than amongst the refined halls of nobles. The advanced tiers allow the caster to shapeshift into animal forms: wolf, snake, and dragon.</p1> 
        <p1>Casting any of the shapshifting spells allows the caster to transform to and from the listed animal for an entire season. Transforming may be done at any time and takes no time. The player chooses at the start of their turns whether to be in human or animal form, and must remain that way for their whole turn. This is true for both the Challenge Phase as well as the Conflict Phase.</p1> 
        <p1>While in animal form, the caster uses the provided statblock instead of their own. Furthermore, the caster loses access to all of their normal skills, stunts, and aspects, with the exception of keeping the ability to transform back into a human. Most of the skills for the animal are expressed in terms of the caster&apos;s <skill>Lore</skill> rather than as absolute values. Consequences and stress tracks need to be recalculated based on the new <skill>Physique</skill> and <skill>Will</skill> of the animal.</p1> 
        <stuntt>Primal Quickness</stuntt> 
        <stuntp>1+ Mana</stuntp> 
        <stuntd>The caster taps into a preternatural quickness and strength. Spend a point of mana to use <skill>Lore</skill> in place of <skill>Athletics</skill>. Additional mana may be spent as Fate points to modify the roll.</stuntd> 
        <stuntt>Fangs of the Wolf</stuntt>

        <h1>Designer’s Notes</h1> 
        <p1>The effect of mana exponentially increases at higher levels, and is (loosely) based on the difficulty it takes to improve the skill pyramid. For any particular secret, there are smoothing operations done so that the units and effects are easier to manage, but each secret is based on the power curve listed in the table below. If you wish to design your own secrets, this table can serve as a rough guide for effects. For instance, if we take 1 mana expenditure to be 1 ft of range, 18 mana would be roughly 3.88 miles.</p1>
