<chapter>Infiltration</chapter>
Infiltration involves covert operations targeting a physical installation (called <term>the house</term>). Infiltration is the conflict used for assassination, sabotage, and heist missions. Whether stealing secret arcane formulae or laying waste to an ore refinery, the most important part of infiltration is the ability to carry out the plan without being detected.
The heroes must sneak through the target location, avoiding or deceiving guards, while overcoming a number of security challenges (vaults, secure doors, observant guards, traps) in the process. Infiltration is not without risk. It’s possible for one or more of the heroes to get caught in the act, making them unavailable for future missions until they’re rescued.
<h1>Challenges</h1>
During the challenge phase, the Stronghold players case the house, working to get access as well as uncover details about the target. The heroes may also try to find a safe house, connect with contacts, or use social engineering to exploit a source. The group can use the challenges as a collaborative vehicle to flesh out the house. What’s stored inside? Who has access to it? Can you get close to them? What security measures are in place? What vulnerabilities does it have?
However, as with all missions, don’t start playing through the conflict! The challenges should touch on the plan, but shouldn’t directly accomplish the mission (stealing the plans, assassinating the target, etc.). That’s covered during the infiltration conflict.
<h1>Opposition</h1>
The opposition comes from <term>guards</term> trying to detect the heroes. Guards are built as minions. Guards are a particularly good use for no skill minions (see <chapref>Characters</chapref>, page XX). If the mission involves a faction, a leader from the faction may take the place of one of the guards.
<h2>Creating Opposition</h2>
It’s quickest to use no skill minions for guards. If they’re built as regular minions, a high Wits skill is important for the guards to detect heroes. Athletics and Fighting are good for detaining heroes. Giving guards a higher Fighting skill helps push the action toward stealth and fast talking, as overt aggression becomes riskier.
<h2>Sample Guards</h2>
These sample guards can get you started. It’s easiest if all the guards share the same template. These are easy to convert to no skill minions. Simply get rid of the skills and stunts, and set all of the stress tracks to two.

<h1>Setup</h1>
The players collaboratively come up with a plan, make a map of the house, flesh out the security challenges, and then place the heroes, initial guards, and alarms. First, gather together a number of notecards equal to three times the number of Stronghold players for use in creating the zones of the house. Add to this one notecard with the label <i>Outside the House</i>.
<h2>Security Challenges</h2>
As the heroes go through the challenge phase, the players create details about the house. These details form the basis of the plan to crack the house. Imagine the heroes are huddled over a table at the back of the inn, drawing out who goes where and when to accomplish the task.
Mechanically, each stage in the plan is represented as a <term>security challenge</term>. These work very similarly to challenges in the challenge phase. The players must create one security challenge for each hero on the mission. Each security challenge is written on a separate notecard.
The security challenges aren’t created using the challenge list. Instead, each challenge has one skill that must be used to overcome it. There must be one Thievery, one Disguise, and one Stealth security challenge. Write these skills on separate notecards. If there are four heroes, add another Thievery security challenge, and if there are five players, add another Disguise challenge.
Draw a card for each of these security challenges, adding the listed suns and moons to the challenge. The difficulty for the challenge is found by adding the result to the mission difficulty, as it is for regular challenges. When this process is finished, there should be three to five security challenges on different notecards. These challenges don’t have thematic details or locations associated with them. That comes later.
<h2>Alarms</h2>
The Autarch player should write the aspect <aspect>Alarm</aspect> on a number of blank notecards equal to half the heroes (round down). These alarm zones can be used by alerted guards to sound the alarm, bringing in more reinforcements.
<h2>Create the Map</h2>
First, place the <i>Outside the House</i> zone out on the table. Next, shuffle all of the security challenge cards, the alarm cards, and the remaining blank cards together. The Autarch player and the spotlight player take turns placing the notecards on the table. The Autarch player goes first, taking the top notecard and placing it next to the <i>Outside the House</i> card. Next, the spotlight player draws a card, and places it adjacent to the card the Autarch player placed.
The Autarch player and spotlight player alternate turns, placing cards on the table until there are no cards left. Notecards must be placed with one edge adjacent to one or more other notecards. In addition, all zones must be reachable without going outside the house (that is, the house can’t be split into two parts).
<h2>Detail the Map</h2>
The group collaboratively comes up with locations for the zones that feature challenges (<i>The Hall</i>, <i>The Courtyard</i>, <i>The Baron’s Bedchamber</i>) and writes them on each card. The spotlight player writes suitably thematic challenge titles on each security challenge card (<i>Main Office: Crack the Vault - 5 Thievery</i>, <i>Library: Convince Baron von Schlefwitz to Retrieve the Tome - 7 Disguise</i>).
<h2>Place Guards</h2>
The Autarch player starts with a number of guards equal to half the heroes (round down). Each guard is placed on the edge of one of the notecards. It’s fine to place multiple guards on the same zone.
<h2>Aspect Burning</h2>
Each free invoke burned can be used to allow a hero unrestricted access to a zone (by default heroes are not allowed in any zones) or to add a new zone to the map.
<h1>The Exchange</h1>
Each hero takes an action in any order desired by the spotlight player. Next, unalerted guards patrol, moving one zone. Alerted guards may optionally move. After movement, each guard and leader takes one action in any order desired by the Autarch player. Finally, more guards may arrive.
<h1>Actions</h1>
When a character takes a turn, they choose one of the following actions: 
<list>
Focus
Remove Suspicion and Alerts (Heroes only)
Detect Intruder (Guards only)
Capture Intruder (Guards only)
Resolve Security Challenge (Heroes only)
Movement
Attack (Heroes only)
Raise the Alarm (Guards only)
</list>
Some actions are only available to heroes while some are only available to the opposition leaders.
<h2>Suspicion and Alert</h2>
If a hero fails <i>any</i> action, the nearest guard gets the aspect <aspect>Suspicious</aspect> with one free invoke. If any guards are <i>in the same zone</i> as the hero when an action is failed, each guard in the zone gets the aspect <aspect>Alerted!</aspect> with two free invokes.
<h2>Focus</h2>
If a character has no boosts, they may use the focus action to take one boost. This action is not available to minions. Boosts may be spent as normal. See <chapref>Core Rules</chapref> (page XX) for more details.
<h2>Remove Suspicion and Alerts (Heroes, Overcome)</h2>
Since these are just aspects, a hero can attempt to use an overcome action to get rid of them, resulting in the guard going back to a normal state. This is done used Disguise opposed by Wits for the guard. If the alarm has been raised, this action is not available.
<h2>Detect Intruder (Guards, Overcome)</h2>
Guards may attempt to detect a hero in the same zone. The guard uses Wits, opposed by either Stealth (if the hero is hiding) or Disguise (if the hero has a cover identity). Since the hero is in the same zone, if the hero fails to defend, the guards in the same zone are alerted (they gain the <aspect>Alerted!</aspect> aspect with one free invoke).
<h2>Capture Intruder (Guards, Overcome)</h2>
Alerted guards may attempt to capture a hero in the same zone. The guard uses Fighting, opposed by either Fighting or Athletics. If the guard is successful, the hero is captured, and both the guard and the hero are removed from the map.
<h2>Resolve Security Challenge (Heroes, Overcome)</h2>
This works similarly to removing challenges in the challenge phase. The challenge is removed if the hero succeeds (with the suns causing stress as for regular challenges). Similarly, moons must be removed first.
However, failure is handled a little differently. Instead of failing the challenge and giving the Autarch player a mission aspect, the nearest guard becomes suspicious (as normal for a hero failing an action).
<h2>Movement</h2>
Movement for heroes uses Athletics, and functions as described in <chapref>Conflicts</chapref> (page XX). However, because heroes are trying not to attract attention, they must stop movement when entering a zone with a guard, or the guard immediately becomes alerted. Alerted guards oppose movement out of the zone.
<h3>Guard Movement</h3>
Guards <term>patrol</term>, moving only one zone each exchange in the direction they’re facing, turning around when they run out of room. Place guards at one edge of the notecard they’re on to indicate the direction they will move next turn. Suspicious and alerted guards move as heroes do.
<h2>Attack</h2>
Heroes may attack using Fighting or Marksmanship. These work as they do in the skirmish conflict (page XX). If a guard is attacked, the immediately gain the <aspect>Alerted!</aspect> aspect with two free invokes. Furthermore, the nearest guard becomes suspicious from the sounds of battle (gains the <aspect>Suspicious</aspect> with one free invoke).
<h2>Raise the Alarm (Guards Only)</h2>
If an alerted guard ends their action in a zone with an alarm, the alarm is sounded. All guards become alerted, and may move and attack freely.?
<h1>More Guards</h1>
After each exchange, the Autarch player may place one guard in any empty zone. If the alarm has sounded, the Autarch player may place two guards each exchange. Time is of the essence!
<h1>Resolution</h1>
The heroes are successful when all the security challenges are completed and at least one hero makes it back <i>Outside the House</i>. Once in the <i>Outside the House</i> zone, a hero is out of the conflict. They take no more actions.
The conflict is over when all the heroes are either <i>Outside the House</i> or captured.
If any heroes are caught, the disposition of the faction drops by two. Furthermore, the captured hero is unavailable for any future missions until they’re rescued during Stronghold upkeep (see <chapref>Seasons</chapref>, page XX).
