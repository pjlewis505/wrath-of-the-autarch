<chapter>Crescent Hold</chapter>
Crescent Hold produces a fantastic variety of materials and tools made from the various ores they mine from deep underground. These goods are highly valued throughout the Realm.
Fortunately for Crescent Hold, their habitats aren’t very accessible, to say the least. From a combination of natural wonders and engineering marvels, access to their cities is possible only through invitation or incredible bloodshed. Unfortunately for the people of Crescent Hold, life can be very harsh, with cold winter temperatures and dismal conditions underground for the miners.
The attitudes of leadership can sometimes reflect the harsh realities of the land. While there are opportunities for both genders, Crescent Hold is hardly egalitarian. There is a great deal of structure in each aspect of life and within the government, with orders largely expected to be followed.
The ruling system is also very hierarchical, with small committees running each segment of life: military matters, civic culture, food production, etc. The process of promotion within these groups tends to be from within, creating an insular and somewhat plutocratic rule. However, promotion is largely based on merit, rather than other extraneous factors.

<stunt>Improved Favored Weapon (Fighting)</stunt>
</stats>
An iconoclast within the Hold, favoring sweeping action and power. Almor listens to The Boar’s opinions, much to the chagrin of Agatha.
<h1>Diplomacy</h1>
Agatha has most of the authority for determining how the Crescent Hold deals with the Stronghold, particularly in matters of trade. However, her authority is tempered by Almor’s influence on matters of war and Theas’ knowledge of other societies. Crescent Hold values technology, order, and defense. Another theme of the challenges are flare-ups arising from the poor working conditions of the miners.
<b>Base Difficulty:</b> 3
<h2>Sample Challenges</h2>
<list>
Convince, Agatha, Garodes, and the rest of the Council of Trade that the Stronghold is reliable.
Repair the primary drill south of the Great Hall.
Help an injured miner trapped by falling debris.
Quell a riot along the North Breach.
Diffuse an argument between the Agatha’s conservative approach and The Boar’s recklessness.
Convince Almor that the heroes aren’t spies.
Find the way back to Crescent Hold after getting lost in the mines.
</list>
<h1>Infiltration</h1>
Crescent Hold, with its large fortifications and walled cities, is good at stopping invading armies. However, there are weaknesses in the tunnels below and around Crescent Hold that a small band of infiltrators can take advantage of.
<b>Base Difficulty:</b> 4
<h2>Sample Challenges</h2>
<list>
Pay off the nosy guard Ionnes.
Gain sympathy with Era, an influential miner.
Find position as an archivist within the Learning Council.
Create a device to open the orbital tumbler lock protecting Theron’s Vaults.
</list>
<h1>Skirmish</h1>
The biggest position of strength that Crescent Hold possesses is in the craftsmanship of their weapons and the small groups of very capable warriors who wield them. Having Crescent Hold as an enemy that can potentially launch skirmish attacks at the Stronghold is not a good situation to be in.
<b>Base Difficulty:</b> 6
<h2>Sample Challenges</h2>
<list>
Escape from the The Boar in the Obsidian Wood.
Clash arms with The Three Battle Maidens.
Loose arrows at the Hold Guard from the top of The Great Reach.
Prepare an ambush site outside of Farmer Holden’s south field.
</list>
<h1>Warfare</h1>
Crescent Hold is better prepared to defend against attack than join in attack, but they have a stout military force in either case.
<b>Base Difficulty:</b> 5
<h2>Sample Challenges</h2>
<list>
Engineer a system of bridges to cross the North Ridge.
Find a way around rock traps.
Calm the nerves of troops frightened of marching on the Trail to the Heavens.
Assault the archers occupying the Outer Hold.

Far east of The Great Deeps lies a dead walled off city, The Halls of Aren. Many generations ago, Aren was a promising smith, showing aptitude uncommon amongst his peers. Aren wasn’t satisfied with the slow fitful progress of humans. Unlike his Crescent Hold kin, Aren possessed sorcerous talents which allowed him to uncover a great forge abandoned by an ancient civilization. After a great deal of effort on Aren’s part, the forge bore fruit. Uncanny blades that could quickly fell any foe.
Aren’s forge called out to malevolent imps, inhabitants of that dead civilization from where the forge was born. These creatures, under the command of The Stealer of Hope, a demon who would use the forge for nefarious purposes. Aren, along with the people of Crescent Hold, were driven back, forced to wall off the forge in order to survive. The hatred of that defeat has weighed heavy on the people of Crescent Hold. Agatha and The Boar potentially see the heroes as capable of driving off The Stealer of Hope and reigniting the Aren’s forge for the greater glory of Crescent Hold.
<h2>Sample Challenges</h2>
<list>
Avoid the traps of blasting in the Halls of Aren.
Fight through the defenders of the Hellgate.
Open the Hellgate using the Key of Iron.
Prime the bellows with the blood of the hopeful.
</list>
<h2>Opposition</h2>
The Stealer of Hope along with one Fire Imp for each hero.

<h2>Setup</h2>
The Stealer of Hope will seek out the weakest hero, focusing its energy on taking them out. The imps fly around, trying not to get pinned down, helping to pick off vulnerable heroes.
<h2>Resolution</h2>
The heroes gain access to weapons from Aren’s Forge. When using the Attack action with Fighting or Marksmanship, the suns on the card played apply directly as physical stress to the target, even if the action wasn’t successful. All stress is applied at one time.
