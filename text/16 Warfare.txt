<chapter>Warfare</chapter>
Battles between armies for control of a region are fought using warfare. Warfare is bloody business. Casualties are common for the losing side as well as for the victor.
While having competent military commanders is important, a variety of quality <term>units</term> are also necessary for martial success. The Stronghold must have the correct type of development prior to building units. The units are mustered during the stronghold upkeep phase. Resources are allocated on a per unit basis as they are for other developments. Units are a little like characters, with skills and stunts to use during the battle.
Each side places units under the command of chosen leaders. Zones, representing large areas of land, are created on notecards and a battlefield is constructed. The goal in warfare is to secure the defender’s <term>strategic zone</term>, occupying it with units so that it changes hands.
<h1>Challenges</h1>
Challenges during warfare missions focus on the pain of military life and the struggle to secure strategic advantage. Morale issues, homesick soldiers, fatigue, reconnaissance, environmental hazards, and small battles with enemy forces are all potential challenge scenes.
<h1>Units</h1>
Units are large groups of fighting forces under the control of a leader. Although units aren’t characters, they are composed of similar elements: skills, aspects, and stunts.  Units don’t have stress or consequences.
<h2>Commanders</h2>
Units are assigned to a commander (a hero, faction leader, or lieutenant) who spends fate points on behalf of the unit. Units don’t spend or receive fate points of their own, nor do they get actions independent of their commander.
<h2>Novice Commanders</h2>
If a commander is taken out for any reason, it’s assumed another commander steps up to lead the army. However, all of the novice commander’s skills are Mediocre (+0) and they have no stress boxes or consequences.
<h2>Units and Skills</h2>
Units only have a few types of skills, which more directly reflect the sorts of actions available: Fighting, Lore, Marksmanship, Movement, Armor, and Siege. Movement, Armor, and Siege are skills exclusive to units. Only select unit types have Lore, Marksmanship, and Siege. All units have Fighting, Movement, and Armor. The functions of these skills are explained in <secref>Actions</secref> (page XX).
<h2>Unit Listing</h2>
Following are all the types of units available for purchase during stronghold upkeep: 
<list>
Archers
Battle Mages
Cannons
Catapults
Cavalry
Infantry
Militia
</list>
Units (with the exception of militia) have certain developments that must be purchased before the units can be obtained. See <chapref>Developments</chapref> (page XX) for more details.

Infantry are the bread and butter of any fighting force. They’re cheaper, able to be improved by warfare developments, and help absorb blows as well as deal damage. They’re best paired with other unit types where they can help.

<stunt>Backbone of Labor: </stunt>Each militia unit lost while attacking another faction causes a loss of one stability for the Stronghold (or attacking faction).
</stats>
Militia are cheap, but they’re ineffective and result in greater casualties if their morale breaks. They are not suited to campaigning in far off lands.
<h1>Ramparts</h1>
There are two defensive developments (keeps and castles) that may be placed on regions to help with defense. Keeps and castles are always on the strategic zone (page XX), and prevent movement onto the zone or ranged attacks on the units in the zone until they’re destroyed or somehow neutralized. This is done via Siege attacks opposed by the Armor value of the structure. While this is going on, archers may rain down arrows from the ramparts onto opposing units without fear of reprisal.
<h2>Rampart Listing</h2>
<term>Wall strength</term> functions as a stress track similar to those used by characters. When the structure is taken out from an attack, it is no longer effective and provides no benefits.

<h1>Opposition</h1>
For each hero, the opposing side gets one lieutenant with a skill cap equal to the mission difficulty. If the opponent in the conflict is a faction, the Autarch player can substitute any number of leaders from the faction for lieutenants.
<h2>Creating Commanders</h2>
The most important skills in warfare are Tactics, Command, and Engineering, followed more distantly by Fighting, Athletics, Physique, and Marksmanship.
<h2>Sample Commander</h2>
This sample commander is easy to adjust for the campaign by sliding the given skills up or down as appropriate to meet the mission difficulty.
<stats>
<name>Defensive General (Lieutenant)</name>
<stress><b>Physical</b>	<fate>2</fate></stress>
<stress><b>Mental</b>	<fate>4</fate></stress>
<stress><b>Consequences</b>	-2 <fate>1</fate></stress>
<skill><b>Superb (+5)</b>	Command</skill>
<skill><b>Great (+4)</b>	Tactics</skill>

<skill><b>Fair (+2)</b>	Fighting</skill>
<skill><b>Average (+1)</b>	Engineering</skill>
<aspect>Take the Hill!</aspect>
<aspect>Hold the line!</aspect>
<stunt>Band Together (Command): During warfare, after units have been assigned during a clash of arms action, may swap one defending unit under your command for a different unit that isn’t being attacked.</stunt>
<stunt>Set for Charge (Tactics): During warfare, add +1 to the Armor of infantry and militia units when they defend against charging cavalry (only for the turn the cavalry moved).</stunt>
</stats>
This is a good defensive military leader, with solid Tactics and Command, and two stunts useful for warfare. With the lower Engineering, this leader isn’t as suited to dealing with siege equipment.
<h2>Units for Threats</h2>
For threats that don’t involve enemy factions, it’s necessary to determine the opposing army strength. In this case, gather a number of units equal to twice the difficulty of the threat. At least half of the opposing units should be infantry. The other half can be a mixture of any unit types chosen by the Autarch player.
<h1>Setup</h1>
During setup, each side determines what set of units they have available and assigns them to commanders. The battlefield is created, along with the strategic zone and any terrain. Finally, leaders and attached units are placed onto the battlefield.
<h2>Allocate Units</h2>
Each side allocates units from their available total units. Allies for the Stronghold (minor factions with a disposition of 5 or higher) provide up to three units from their available totals. If warfare involves the Empire, allies for the Autarch (minor factions with a disposition of -4 or lower) provide up to three units to the Autarch.
<h2>Attach Commanders</h2>
Each unit must be attached to one commanding character (a hero, leader, or lieutenant). A commander may control a number of units equal to their Command skill, with a minimum of three. Commanders defending their capital may control one additional unit.
<h2>Champions</h2>
A character may start without commanding any units, in which case the character must be attached to a commander, just as units are. The character moves and acts with their commander. They can’t take any actions that require units, but may take the heroic actions on page XX.
<h2>Create the Battlefield</h2>
Assemble fifteen notecards for creating the battlefield. These zones represent much larger areas of terrain—potentially hundreds of yards across—than the zones in the skirmish or infiltration conflicts. One notecard should be labeled as the <term>strategic zone</term>. This is a vital location that’s being fought over, such as a city center or a valuable mine.
Additionally, the defending side may place four physical obstacles onto the zones, such as marshes, hills, or forests. These may be drawn or written onto the notecards.
The strategic zone is placed by the defending player, and the battlefield is built out from the strategic zone. One side of the strategic zone is designated as the top and one side is designated as the bottom. When placing notecards to build the battlefield, no zones may be placed below the bottom of the strategic zone. The battlefield builds out in three directions from the strategic zone.
The attacking player and defending player alternate placing the zones onto the battlefield, keeping in mind the restriction of not placing zones below the strategic zone. Each notecard must be placed next to a card already in play.
<h2>Place Commanders</h2>
Attacking commanders and attached units are placed first. They must be placed at least <strong>four</strong> zones away from the strategic zone. Defending commanders and attached units must be placed within <strong>two</strong> zones of the strategic zone. Use some marker for each commander (a token or miniature). It’s also easier to visualize attached units if a token of some sort is used for each unit.
<h2>Aspect Burning</h2>
Each free invoke burned may be used to add one new zone or one new terrain obstacle to the battlefield.
<h1>Exchange</h1>
Turns are taken by commanders in the order of their Command skills. Stronghold players go first in the case of ties. Commanders may move one zone and take an action or move more than one zone and spend their exchange doing nothing but moving. Cavalry and infantry have the capability to move more than one zone and still attack.
<h1>Movement</h1>
If movement is unopposed (the moving commander doesn’t leave a zone with enemy units), the commander may move a number of zones equal to the slowest unit’s movement.
Obstacles increase the movement cost by one. As usual, commanders may always move at least one zone. Movement may be opposed as described in <chapref>Conflicts</chapref> (page XX).
<h1>Ranged Attack</h1>
When taking the ranged attack action, the attacking commander allocates units with ranged attack capabilities to fire at defending units under one commander’s control. First, select a defending commander within range. Next, one or more defending units under the commander’s control are targeted. One or more ranged attacking units are paired with each defending unit.
One overcome action is resolved for each group of attackers. The attacking side draws a card, adding the result to the sum of all of the Marksmanship skills for the attacking units. The distance to the target is subtracted from the attack. The defending side draws a card, and adds the result to the defending unit’s Armor skill.
If the attacking group is successful, the defending unit is taken out. On a tie, the attacking commander succeeds at minor cost. Take a stress card and the defending unit is taken out. If either side succeeds with style, they get a boost.
If there are allied units in the same zone as the defending commander, the defending commander gains a boost after the ranged action is resolved. Missile fire is risky when units are engaged with the enemy!
<example>
An attacking commander, controlling four archer units, targets an opposed commander in an adjacent zone. The opposing commander controls two infantry units and one battle mage unit.
The attacker decides to divide up the attack as follows: three archers target one infantry unit and one archer targets the battle mage unit. The remaining infantry isn’t targeted. Assuming the archers didn’t move this turn (archers get a bonus to attack if they haven’t moved), their Marksmanship skill is Fair (+2). The defending units are one zone away, which lowers the attacking total by one (each zone away lowers the attack by one).
The attacking player may choose the order of the attacks. They decide to attack the infantry first. Prior to drawing cards, the attack against the infantry is +5 vs. +4. The attacking player draws a +0 and the defending player draws a +1. A tie! Unless the attacking player spends a fate point, they will need to draw a stress card to take out the opposing unit. The attacking player applies a stress card to their commander. There are three moons on the stress card. That’s quite a bit of mental stress! The commander is suffering from battle fatigue, but the defending infantry unit is taken out.
The attack against the battle mages is +1 vs. +0 prior to drawing cards. The attacking player draws a +0 and the defending player draws a +2, for a total of +1 vs. +2. A failure! The attacking player decides to use a boost to draw a fortune card. Three suns! Now the total is +4 vs. +2. Success! The battle mage unit is removed.

</example>
<h1>Clash of Arms</h1>
Clash of Arms works similarly to ranged attacks. A defending commander in the same zone is chosen as the target of the attack. As in ranged attack, attacking units are allocated to defending units in any way the attacking player chooses. All attacking units must be allocated before checking to see if they successfully attack.
One overcome action is resolved for each group of attacking units (in any order desired by the attacker). The attacking side draws a card, adding the result to the sum of all of the Fighting skills in the attacking group. The defending side draws a card, adding the result to the Armor skill of the defending unit.
If the attacking group is successful, the defending unit is taken out. On a tie, the attacking commander succeeds at minor cost. Take a stress card and the defending unit is taken out. If either side succeeds with style, they get a boost.
<example>
An attacking commander, controlling three infantry and two militia, targets an opposed commander in an adjacent zone. The opposing commander controls three archers and two infantry. Archers have very poor armor, so they’re ripe for the picking!
The militia aren’t defending their homeland, so their attack is only Average (+1). The attacking commander decides to commit the two militia and one infantry to attack one archer. That’s a large advantage (+4 attack vs. +2 defense), so it may grant success with style. Then the attacking commander assigns one infantry each to the remaining archers. Those assignments are riskier (+2 attack vs. +2 defense), but it sets up a possible sweep of every defending archer.
The attacking commander resolves the advantageous attack first, and gets success with style for a boost! One archer unit is removed.
The next attack results in success with style for the defender, bad luck! The attacking commander uses the boost to draw a fortune card, getting enough suns to change it into a regular failure. The defender no longer has success with style and will not get a boost.
Finally, the last attack is resolved. The attacker succeeds and another archer is removed! After the clash, the defending commander now has one archer and two infantry.
</example>
<h2>Outflank</h2>
After the clash of arms is resolved in a zone, the defending side may be able to immediately make an attack with any surviving units. The commanders make opposed Tactics checks as an overcome action. If the defender succeeds, they may make attacks with surviving units. This doesn’t count as the defending commander’s action (they may have already taken an action or may still have an action to take).
<example>
The defending commander from the previous example may be able to return the favor. The attacking commander’s Tactics is Good (+3) and the defending commander’s Tactics is Great (+4). The defending commander makes an overcome action, using opposed Tactics. The defending commander gets Superb (+5) and the attacking commander gets Good (+3)—the defender outflanks the attacker and immediately gets to assign units and attack!
The defending commander assigns an archer and an infantry to one of the militia and the remaining infantry to the final militia. The militia should be easy enough to take out!
The defending commander attacks with the archer and infantry first. The result of the attack is Fair (+2), not enough for success with style, but enough to take out a militia! The final attack also goes well for the defending commander, resulting in Average (+1). Both militia are removed!
Having a higher Tactics than opposing commanders comes in handy during the clash of arms. The defending commander still hasn’t acted, so they’ll also get an action to either initiate an attack, or maybe move away and use archers while other units maneuver on the battlefield.
</example>
<h1>Heroic Action</h1>
Each champion or commander that hasn’t already taken an action may take one of the actions below. These actions work much like the actions available in <chapref>Skirmish</chapref> (page XX).
<h2>Focus</h2>
If a character has no boosts, they may use the focus action to take one boost. This action is not available to minions. Boosts may be spent as normal. See <chapref>Core Rules</chapref> (page XX) for more details.
<h2>Attack</h2>
A commander may be attacked directly. This works identically to the attack actions in <chapref>Skirmish</chapref> (page XX).
<h2>Defend</h2>
Commanders defend using standard skills (Fighting vs. Fighting or Athletics vs. Marksmanship or Fighting).
<h1>Resolution</h1>
If at least one attacking unit begins an exchange in the strategic zone with no opposing units in the same zone, the attacking force is successful. Warfare also ends if the attacking or defending force moves all units off the battlefield (moving off the edge of the map will remove the commander and all associated units from the battle).
