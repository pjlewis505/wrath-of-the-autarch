<chapter>Missions</chapter>
Missions are the core currency of Wrath of the Autarch. While the populace of the Stronghold undertakes all sorts of activities during a season, only the missions are played out in detail. The Stronghold players choose one mission each season. Each type of mission has certain benefits as well as possible costs. Missions provide the strategic backbone for the campaign. They also function to set the tone for the session.
There are seven types of missions available for players to choose from: alliance, conquest, sabotage, assassination, quest, threat, and scheme. Each of these mission types is not always available for the players to pick. For instance, if the heroes don’t have strong enough alliances with any minor factions, they may not go on a quest.
<h1>Structure</h1>
Missions are composed of a <term>challenge phase</term> followed by one of four <term>conflicts</term> (either <term>diplomacy</term>, <term>infiltration</term>, <term>skirmish</term>, or <term>warfare</term>).
<h2>Challenge Phase</h2>
During the challenge phase the players set up scenes and the heroes must confront a variety of challenges. The challenge phase is heavy on the narrative, light on the tactics. The Stronghold players may also create aspects to use in the conflict (mission aspects) or even in future missions (campaign aspects). Time scales tend to be very fluid during the challenge phase, as all the players can exert considerable narrative control on the story, using flashbacks and cut scenes as desired to frame the story.
<h2>Conflict</h2>
The particular conflict used depends on the mission chosen by the players. Conflicts are built from the same action types, but each type has slight tweaks to better evoke the feel of the conflict. Conflicts are heavy on the tactics and lighter on the narrative. Time scales for conflicts are usually shorter than for the challenge phase.
Diplomacy is the art of negotiation and deal making. Infiltration is a system for sneaking into a physical space without being detected. Skirmishes showcase the fighting of small battles between heroes and other opponents, both mundane and monstrous. Finally, Warfare is the clashing of armies on the battlefield. Each of these four conflicts has a chapter dedicated to it, detailing their differences.
The choice of conflict has an impact on the theme and tone of the challenge phase. The chapters for the conflicts have suggestions and notes on how to handle the challenge phase leading up to that conflict.
<h1>Choosing a Mission</h1>
The Stronghold players choose one of the following missions each season, paying close attention to any requirements that must be first met. The mission descriptions list the rewards for successfully completing a mission as well as the penalties for failure. In addition, they provide details on how to handle challenges and which conflict is used.
<h1>Conquest</h1>
Conquest is the way new regions are added to the Stronghold. Conquest could be directed toward one of the ten unexplored regions in the game, or it could come from military action against another faction. The unexplored regions each have different amounts of resources that can be gained from successful exploration. A variety of conflicts may be necessary to conquer unexplored regions, although skirmish is the most common. The <chapref>Regions</chapref> chapter lists all of the different neutral regions.
Conquering regions controlled by another faction requires units and is typically more difficult than looking toward unexplored regions. If a faction loses their capital, the faction collapses, so conquest is also the method by which other factions can be dismantled. See the <chapref>Factions</chapref> chapter for more on capitals.
<h2>Requirements</h2>
One of the unexplored regions in the <chapref> Regions</chapref> chapter (not already under the Stronghold’s control) or a region controlled by a faction should be chosen as a target. At least one unit from the Stronghold is needed if warfare is used to conquer a region.
<h2>Difficulty, Conflict Type</h2>
For unexplored regions, the mission is already fleshed out in the <chapref>Regions</chapref> chapter. The mission difficulty and conflict type are found in the description for the particular neutral region.
For regions controlled by factions, warfare is always used. The difficulty is listed in the faction chapter. The difficulty of conquering an Imperial region depends on how many points are allocated to the Empire’s warfare schemes, but at the start of the campaign the Empire’s warfare difficulty is 4. Attacking another faction lowers their disposition down to -5 (it’s hard to make friends when you’re seizing their land by military force).
<table>
<th><b>Faction</b>	<b>Warfare Difficulty</b></th>
<b>Autarch</b>	4*
<b>Burgan Vale</b>	5
<b>Crescent Hold</b>	5
<b>Gravewood</b>	4
<b>Lily Manor</b>	3
<b>Sunriders</b>	6
</table>
<h2>Success</h2>
If the heroes of the Stronghold are successful, write the region down onto the Stronghold sheet. The resources of the region may be harvested starting on the next Stronghold upkeep phase.
If the region conquered was a faction’s capital, the faction immediately collapses and ceases to function. See the Collapse section in the <chapref>Factions</chapref> chapter. The Stronghold gains any two regions under the control of the faction (although these regions only have half the listed resources, rounded down). Conquering the Empire’s capital wins the game for the Stronghold.
Even with success, using warfare has potentially high costs in terms of population and stability. See the <chapref>Warfare</chapref> chapter for more details.
<h2>Failure</h2>
If the heroes fail to conquer a region, there are no penalties other than the loss of time on the part of the heroes (and potentially consequences that heroes have sustained). If warfare is used, units could be lost and stability possibly lowered. The region is not added to the Stronghold sheet, but the mission for the same region may be attempted again.
<h1>Alliance</h1>
Alliance missions are a way to increase the disposition with minor factions. Increased disposition gives access to better trade rates while building developments. A disposition of +3 or higher gives the Stronghold access to the quest mission provided by the faction, and a disposition of +5 or higher means the minor faction will commit military units for the Stronghold in war.
<h2>Requirements</h2>
A particular faction is chosen as the target of the Alliance mission.
<h2>Difficulty</h2>?
The difficulty of the Alliance mission depends on the faction chosen to trade with, as detailed in the <chapref>Factions</chapref> chapter. Note that an Alliance mission with the Empire isn’t with the Empire proper, but with an underground resistance within the Empire (see the <chapref>Empire</chapref> chapter for more details). The Empire despises the Stronghold too much to initiate trade.
<table>
<th><b>Faction</b>	<b>Difficulty</b>	<b>Goods (Faction Specialty)</b></th>
<b>Resistance</b>	5	Empire Stability Loss
<b>Burgan Vale</b>	4	Mana (Arcane)
<b>Crescent Hold</b>	3	Ore (Skirmish)
<b>Gravewood</b>	5	Timber (Infiltration)
<b>Lily Manor</b>	6	Luxuries (Diplomacy)
<b>Sunriders</b>	4	Food (Warfare)	
</table>
<h2>Conflict</h2>
Diplomacy is used to resolve Alliance missions.
<h2>Success</h2>
The disposition with the faction is improved by one or more (developments may modify this).
<h2>Failure</h2>
Either there is no change in disposition, or it could drop if things go very poorly. See the <chapref>Diplomacy</chapref> chapter for more details.
<h1>Sabotage</h1>
The goal of sabotage is to cause stability loss through disruption of critical services or a campaign of misinformation.
<h2>Requirements</h2>
A target faction must be chosen. The difficulty is based on the faction targeted, as detailed in the <chapref>Factions</chapref> chapter. The difficulty of targeting the Empire depends on how many points are allocated to the Empire’s Infiltration threat pool, but at the start of the campaign the Empire’s difficulty is 4.
<table>
<th><b>Faction</b>	<b>Difficulty</b></th>
<b>Autarch</b>	4*
<b>Burgan Vale</b>	5
<b>Crescent Hold</b>	4
<b>Gravewood</b>	6	
<b>Lily Manor</b>	5
<b>Sunriders</b>	3	
</table>
<h2>Conflict</h2>
Sabotage missions use the infiltration conflict.
<h2>Success</h2>
A successfully sabotaged faction loses one stability (possibly more with the use of certain infiltration developments).
<h2>Failure</h2>
If heroes are caught, they are imprisoned, and the disposition with the target faction drops by two. It is possible to fail missions that use infiltration without getting caught, in which case the only loss is the wasted season of time.
<h1>Assassination</h1>
The art of eliminating a faction leader through stealth and guile. The Autarch may be targeted.
<h2>Requirements</h2>
Choose a faction leader as the target of assassination. The different faction chapters detail the leaders for each faction.
The difficulty is based on the faction targeted, as detailed in the <chapref>Factions</chapref> chapter. For targeting the Autarch, the difficulty is fixed at 8. Otherwise, the difficulty of targeting an Imperial leader besides the Autarch depends on how many points are allocated to the Empire’s Infiltration threat pool, but at the start of the campaign the difficulty is 4.
<table>
<th><b>Faction</b>	<b>Difficulty</b></th>
<b>Autarch</b>	4*, 8*
<b>Burgan Vale</b>	5
<b>Crescent Hold</b>	4
<b>Gravewood</b>	6
<b>Lily Manor</b>	5
<b>Sunriders</b>	3	
</table>
<h2>Conflict</h2>
Assassination missions use the infiltration conflict.
<h2>Success</h2>
The targeted leader is killed, and may not be used in any capacity by the faction. If the Autarch is targeted, the Stronghold has successfully won the campaign.
<h2>Failure</h2>
If heroes are caught, they are imprisoned, and the disposition with the target faction drops by three. It is possible to fail missions that use the infiltration conflict without getting caught, in which case the only loss is the wasted season of time.
<h1>Heist</h1>
The goal of heist is to steal resources from a faction.
<h2>Requirements</h2>
A target faction must be chosen. The difficulty is based on the faction targeted, as detailed in the <chapref>Factions</chapref> chapter. The difficulty of targeting the Empire depends on how many points are allocated to the Empire’s Infiltration threat pool, but at the start of the campaign the Empire’s difficulty is 4.
<table>
<th><b>Faction</b>	<b>Difficulty</b></th>
<b>Autarch</b>	4*
<b>Burgan Vale</b>	5
<b>Crescent Hold</b>	4
<b>Gravewood</b>	6	
<b>Lily Manor</b>	5
<b>Sunriders</b>	3	
</table>
<h2>Conflict</h2>
Heist missions use the infiltration conflict.
<h2>Success</h2>
A successful heist allows the Stronghold to gain one additional resource die on their next Stronghold upkeep phase. The stolen resource must be listed on one of the targeted faction’s regions. That coveted luxury die is only available by targeting Lily Manor or Gravewood.
<h2>Failure</h2>
If heroes are caught, they are imprisoned, and the disposition with the target faction drops by two. It is possible to fail missions that use infiltration without getting caught, in which case the only loss is the wasted season of time.
<h1>Quest</h1>
In the remote corners of the Realm are mythical artifacts potentially swinging the long struggle in favor of the Stronghold. Artifacts are always very dangerous to retrieve.
<h2>Requirements</h2>
There are five artifacts in the game, each of which is buried deep in the secrecy and lore of one of the five minor factions. The Stronghold must have a disposition of +3 or higher with the faction related to the artifact they desire before they learn of its existence.
<h2>Difficulty, Conflict</h2>
The difficulty of all quests is 6, but the conflict used depends on the specific quest. See the different faction chapters for more details.
<h2>Success</h2>
The Stronghold gains the artifact, along with all of its abilities. Most artifacts function like developments in that they aid all of the heroes rather than just one.
<h2>Failure</h2>
There is no penalty for failure other than spending a season unsuccessfully questing. Quests may be attempted multiple times.
<h1>Threats and Schemes</h1>
Threats and schemes are hardships that the Stronghold must deal with over the course of the campaign. Instead of being driven by choices the Stronghold players make, threats and schemes occur by chance or are directed by the Autarch player. Since threats and schemes are not initiated by the Stronghold players, they may be ignored. However, the repercussions for ignoring them are usually worse than trying to deal with them and failing. Some developments make the Stronghold resistant to certain threats. There are no developments which help with Autarch schemes.
There are two types of threats: <term>region</term> and <term>faction</term>. Threats and schemes have the usual mission structure of a challenge phase and a conflict. However, they have different repercussions for ignoring them. The occurrence of threats and schemes is determined at the end of the season, see the <chapref>Seasons</chapref> chapter for more details. The nature and composition of region threats and faction threats are completely random events, while Autarch schemes are chosen by the Autarch player.?
<h1>Region Threat</h1>?
The more lands controlled by the Stronghold, the more chance those holdings come under threat. Region threats are disruptions of supply, caused from marauding beasts, sneaky bandits, or even disgruntled peasants.
<h2>Difficulty, Conflict</h2>?
The <chapref>Threats</chapref> chapter has various region threats fleshed out. When a Region Threat occurs, roll on the Region Threat Table in the <chapref>Threats</chapref> chapter to determine the difficulty and conflict to use. Most region threats use skirmish.
<h2>Success</h2>
Supply from the region is restored, and the Stronghold also adds one to stability.?
<h2>Failure</h2>
Even with failure, the region still provides resources, although the Stronghold loses one stability.
<h2>Ignore</h2>
The region doesn’t provide resources, the Stronghold loses one stability, and the Autarch player may create a campaign aspect with two free invokes.
<h1>Faction Threat</h1>?
Faction threats are sources of strife that threaten relations with factions. They could be calls for aid from the faction, minor border and territory disputes, or cultural disagreements.?
<h2>Difficulty, Conflict</h2>
The <chapref>Threats</chapref> chapter has some faction threats fleshed out. If the faction threat is with an ally (the faction has a disposition of -1 or higher), the conflict and difficulty are determined randomly. When a faction threat with an ally occurs, roll on the Ally Faction Threat Table in the <chapref>Threats</chapref> chapter to determine the difficulty and conflict. Most faction threats use diplomacy.
If the faction is an enemy (a disposition of -2 or below), the Autarch determines the type of conflict. The difficulty is listed in the chapter for the specific faction.
<h2>Success</h2>
On success, the Stronghold has handled the situation well and disposition with the faction increases by one.
<h2>Failure</h2>
The disposition with the faction holds steady.?
<h2>Ignore</h2>?
The disposition with the faction drops by one and the Autarch player may create a campaign aspect with two free invokes.?
<h1>Autarch Scheme</h1>
Schemes are the main method by which the Autarch player attacks the Stronghold. Schemes are varied, although they have possibly dire consequences for the Stronghold. They tend to mirror the sorts of activities the Stronghold players can do: wage war, assassinate heroes, disrupt supply in region, sabotage developments, and sow dissent among the populace.
<h2>Difficulty, Conflict</h2>
The Autarch player chooses the exact scheme listed from the schemes section of the <chapref>Threats and Schemes</chapref> chapter. The difficulty is based on relevant Empire conflict difficulty. The conflict used for resolution is also based on the particular threat chosen.
<h2>Success, Failure, Ignore</h2>
These depend on the scheme chosen. Usually ignoring the scheme carries a greater penalty than trying but failing.
