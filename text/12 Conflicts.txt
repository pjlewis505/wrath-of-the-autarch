<chapter>Conflicts</chapter>
Conflicts are mini-games based on diplomacy, infiltration, skirmish, or warfare. Conflicts are built from the core actions described in <chapref>Core Rules</chapref> (page XX), although the focus action is used instead of the create advantage action. Conflicts are the most tactical and adversarial part of the game.
<h1>Zones</h1>
Zones are abstractions that usually represent physical spaces. The size of these physical spaces varies greatly depending on the conflict. In warfare, each zone might be an area of roughly 1,000 square yards, while in skirmish one zone might be a room in a house.
Zones could represent almost any physical shape, but in play they’re designated by notecards. Each notecard may be labeled with the name of a zone (<i>bedroom</i>, <i>Red Gulch</i>), or a suitable picture may be drawn on the notecard.
Zones are placed on the table such that one edge of a zone is adjacent to one or more edges of other zones (notecards are placed orthogonally to other notecards). They can’t be connected only through a diagonal. Zones provide a spatial element to conflicts, giving tactical options to characters or military units. There are different restrictions on how one character or unit interacts with others across the zone map.
In diplomacy, zones aren’t physical spaces. Instead, zones represent issues that the two sides are arguing about. As such, zone placement restrictions don’t apply. All zones in diplomacy are considered adjacent to each other.
<h2>Obstacles</h2>
Zones may have obstacles in them. These are usually physical features, like dense foliage, each of which makes movement into the zone more difficult. Obstacles are written or drawn on the zone.
<h1>Actions</h1>
Conflicts are played over exchanges, just like the challenge scene. Each player gets one action each exchange (the specific available actions are based on the type of conflict and are listed in the following chapters).
Unlike the challenge phase, the order of actions is usually based on a particular skill, and isn’t up to the Stronghold players to decide. The create advantage action is not available during a conflict. Instead, two new action types, <term>focus</term> and <term>movement</term>, are available.
<h2>Focus</h2>
The focus action is available in every conflict. It replaces the create advantage action. If a character has no boosts, they may use the focus action to take one boost. This action is not available to minions. Boosts may be spent as normal. See <chapref>Core Rules</chapref> (page XX) for more details.
<h2>Movement</h2>
Movement is conducted by moving characters over the edges of adjacent zones (no diagonal movement is allowed). The maximum amount of movement depends on the conflict type and the skill used for movement.
If a character moves only one zone, they may take a different action either before or after the move. However, they may take stress from being opposed (see “Opposed Movement”).
<h3>Movement Points</h3>
Characters and units have maximum distances they can move. These are expressed in terms of <term>movement points</term>. The number of movement points available is based on Athletics for infiltration and skirmish (see the Athletics skill description on page XX) and from the Movement skill of the slowest commanded unit for warfare. Diplomacy is a little different, as a character may only move one zone (this represents changing the issue they’re arguing about). Movement points aren’t used in diplomacy.
Each obstacle in a zone requires one additional point of movement to enter. A character may always move at least one zone, no matter how many obstacles there are.
<h3>Opposed Movement</h3>
A character leaving a zone that contains opposing characters takes stress as a result. For each such opposing character, apply one stress card when leaving the zone. Assume all characters oppose movement unless specified otherwise.
<diagram>Opposed Movement</diagram>
<example>Lem is fighting a bandit during a skirmish and wishes to move away. Lem has an Athletics of 4, which gives her 3 movement points. When Lem leaves the zone with the bandit, the Autarch player may apply a stress card immediately. This is a consequence of opposed movement. The <i>Marshy Field</i> zone has an obstacle, which makes it cost one extra movement to enter, leaving Lem with one movement left. Lem decides to move down to the <i>Road</i> zone.</example>
<h1>Autarch Fate Points</h1>
The Autarch starts each conflict with fate points equal to the number of heroes. These can be spent in any way desired—they don’t have to be allocated to particular opponents. Unused fate points from the challenge phase are discarded; they don’t carry over to the conflict.
