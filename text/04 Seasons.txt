<chapter>Seasons</chapter>
The campaign for <book>Wrath of the Autarch</book> is organized by seasons. A season of play is designed to take roughly three hours of time to play through, making it a good length of time for the typical session. The main focus for each season is the mission. Missions are covered in the next chapter. In addition to the mission, a season also includes gathering and trading resources, building developments, and determining new threats.
The term season here is used loosely. A mission may take more or less time than three months. It may also be the case that missions overlap somewhat. Although the players undertake only one mission each season, it is assumed that many activities are going on within the Stronghold, such as researching developments. Those activities aren’t worthy of detailed narration. The constraint of one mission per season keeps the pace of the game moving forward and focuses on the big picture. It also makes for difficult choices in terms of allocating scarce resources.
This chapter details the upkeep and development of the Stronghold. It also lists all the steps that book-end a mission. The details of mission structure, as well as the sorts of missions available and what they do for the Stronghold are covered in the next chapter.
<h1>Spotlight Player</h1>
Each session, one player is chosen as the spotlight player. This player has the final say on any choices for the season, such as what developments to build, what mission to undertake, which heroes are chosen. Even more important than resolving disagreements, which probably aren’t that common, the spotlight player has a larger role in the events of the session. As much as possible, the responsibility of spotlight player should rotate among all the players throughout the campaign.
<h2>Modify Relationships</h2>
If desired, the Stronghold player may modify the helpful or hindering relationships for the hero they have chosen for the mission. They should narrate what prompted this change.
<h1>Spring</h1>
At the start of each year, there may be stability increases for the other factions. The cards are shuffled, and one card is drawn for each faction (including the Empire). If the result is +2 or higher, the faction gains one stability. See the <chapref>Factions</chapref> chapter for more details on stability.
<h1>Ignored Threats and Schemes</h1>
Before gaining resources, the penalties for ignored threats are applied to the Stronghold. Note that using a development to deal with a threat isn’t the same as ignoring it (if a development is used, it’s like the threat never happened).
<h2>Regional Threats</h2>
Ignored regional threats make it impossible to gather resources from the region. Ignore that region when calculating resource totals. Furthermore, ignoring a region threat causes the Stronghold to lose one stability.
<h2>Faction Threats</h2>
The result of ignoring a faction threat is different if the faction is an ally (they have a disposition greater than -2) or an enemy (they have a disposition of -2 or lower). If an ally faction threat is ignored, lose one disposition with the faction and no trade with that faction is possible this season. If the faction is an enemy faction, one disposition is loss and the Stronghold loses one stability.
<h2>Autarch Schemes</h2>
There are many different sorts of Autarch schemes available to the Autarch player. They have different effects if ignored. See the <chapref>Threats</chapref> chapter for more details.
<h1>Stronghold Upkeep</h1>
During Stronghold upkeep, the spotlight player gathers resources, trades, builds developments, and feeds the populace. Optionally, they may hold a festival or stage a prison break. Lay out the chronicle of trade and the five tech trees found at the end of the book.
<h2>Gather Resources</h2>
The first step during Stronghold upkeep is to sum all the resources for regions controlled by the Stronghold. These should be tracked on the Stronghold sheet, but could be modified based on regional threats or other effects. Gather one six sided die for each resource, using different colored dice for each resource type (for example, 3 green d6 could be used for 3 timber).
After gathering the appropriate dice, they are all rolled. All purchases (developments, feeding the populace, festivals, etc) during the Stronghold upkeep phase must be made using whole dice. Any leftover amount on the dice isn’t used (if something costs 6 timber, and there are only two timber dice showing 5 and 3, both dice must be allocated to meet the cost).

<h3>Build Developments</h3>
The main use of resource dice is to build developments. Each development requires a certain amount of resources to complete. In addition, most developments have other developments as prerequisites. All prerequisite developments must be built first. See the <chapref>Developments</chapref> chapter for more details.
Any number of developments may be built in a season provided that all the resource costs are met. The benefits of developments take effect immediately. Since ignored threats have already been applied, it is too late to use a just purchased development to stop a threat.
Units are built at the same time as well. Purchasing units follows the same process. The same rule about whole dice applies to each such unit created.
<h3>Trade</h3>
The chronicle of trade lists the benefits of trade with other factions, based on current disposition. Each faction may only be traded with once each season. Trading is done by taking the dice desired by the faction from the seasonal total and placing them on the faction’s entry on the chronicle of trade sheet. Next, the listed amount of dice are taken from the supply and rolled. These dice are then added to the seasonal total. Any trade rate at or below the current disposition may be used, but only one such trade is allowed each season. Remember that ignored ally threats prohibit trade with the faction this season.
<example>Example: The Stronghold’s disposition with Gravewood is at 3. The spotlight player could either trade 2 luxury dice for 5 timber dice (rolling the timber dice immediately) or take the lesser trade of 1 luxury die for 2 timber dice (again, rolling them immediately). If either option is taken, no more trading is possible with Gravewood for the remainder of the season. Placing the luxury dice onto the Gravewood box on the Chronicle of Trade is a good way to remember which factions have been traded with.</example>
<h3>Luxuries</h3>
Luxuries provide an additional benefit: a luxury die can be discarded to re-roll any dice of one resource type. A luxury die used in this fashion is removed from the gathered resources for the season and can’t be used for anything else.
<h3>Feed the Populace</h3>
Besides building developments, the population must be fed. This requires twice as much food as the Stronghold has regions (for example, 12 food is needed if the Stronghold has six regions). Note that this is total food (the value on the dice), not the number of food dice. The same rule applies that whole dice must be allocated, however.
If there is less food available than twice the number of regions, the stability of the Stronghold drops by one. If there is less food than the number of regions, the stability instead drops by two. This is summarized on the chronicle of trade.
If desired, the Stronghold players may purposefully not fully feed the population in order to have extra food to invest for other uses. This option can only be taken if the Stronghold actually has stability to lose (the stability is above -6).
<h3>Festivals</h3>
Festivals may be held at a price equal to the number of regions in luxuries. Similar to feeding the population, this is the total value on luxury dice, not the number of dice. Spending luxuries in such a way increases the stability by one.
<h3>Prison Break</h3>
Finally, a hero may be rescued from imprisonment by assigning heroes to break them out. These heroes may not go on the mission for the season. To see if they were successful, draw a card and add the highest Thievery skill of all heroes present. Any helping heroes also assigned may add one to the result provided they have a Thievery skill of one or higher. If this result is equal to or higher than the infiltration difficulty of the faction that captured them, the hero has been rescued and may be used in the future. The result may not be modified with free invokes or fate points.
<h1>Mission</h1>
After Stronghold upkeep, the chosen mission is played through. The <chapref>Missions</chapref> chapter contains details on how missions are structured as well as the different sorts of missions available. Before and after the mission there are a few steps that must be taken that are covered here.
<h2>Choose Heroes</h2>
The first step before going on a mission is to choose heroes. The spotlight player chooses first. Think about the suitability of the different heroes for the mission at hand. This is mostly determined by the skills of the heroes and the type of conflict the mission uses. The list below summarizes which skills are most useful for each conflict, although different sorts of magic (via Lore stunts) can substitute for these skills.
<list>
<b>Diplomacy—</b>Rapport, Society, Wits
<b>Infiltration—</b>Stealth, Thievery, Disguise, Athletics
<b>Skirmish—</b>Fighting, Marksmanship, Athletics, Survival
<b>Warfare—</b>Tactics, Command, Engineering
</list>
<h2>Training and Recovery</h2>
Before going on the mission, heroes may be able to recover consequences and train skills. On the top of the character sheet is the last season the hero went on a mission. For each season of downtime between then and the current season (each open checkbox), the hero may add an advance to one skill (mark one of the three boxes next to a skill on the character sheet) <b>and</b> make one season of progress towards removing a consequences.
Major and minor consequences take one season to resolve, while severe consequences take two seasons.
<example>Fuscus was last on a mission six seasons ago (it’s Spring of Year 4, and Summer of Year 2 was his last mission), which means there were five seasons of downtime that Fuscus could train and recover consequences. Fuscus has both a major and a severe consequence. The severe consequence has one check of progress. Fuscus removes both the major and severe consequence (requiring two seasons of downtime) and marks five skill advances.</example>
Finally, update the last mission date to the current season on the top of the character sheet.
<h3>Advance Skills</h3>
After any training is done, any skills which have three advances (whether through training or during a mission) may be raised by one. However, there is a restriction that every skill must have at least one skill in the rank below it. For instance, if a character has a Superb (+5) Fighting skill that has three advances, and no other Superb skills, the player may not advance it, since that would leave a Fantastic (+6) Fighting skill with no Superb (+5) skills in the rank directly below. This prevents advancing one skill up the ladder without taking at least a few others along the way.
If a skill is increased by one rank, erase all the advances. Skills advancing to the rank of Superb (+5) or higher gain the hero one additional stunt from the skill’s stunt list. See the <chapref>Skills and Stunts</chapref> chapter for more details on stunts.
<h2>Starting Fate Points</h2>
Each Stronghold player starts the mission with two fate points. Starting fate points are modified by the Stronghold stability. If stability is -3 or -4 each player starts with one and if it’s -5 or -6 each player starts with none!
However, if Stronghold stability is +3 or +4 each player starts with three fate points and if it’s +5 or +6 each player starts with four. The spotlight player may get extra fate points from setting aside resource dice during the spending of resources (gain one fate point for every two dice). A maximum of two additional fate points may be gained for the spotlight player in such a manner.
<h2>Refresh Consequence Free Invokes</h2>
If a hero has any consequences, the free invokes for those consequences are cleared if they’re filled in. The Autarch player may freely invoke consequences each season on heroes. Consequences are the gift that keeps on giving!
<h2>Play Mission</h2>
The main part of a season consists of playing through the chosen mission. Playing through the challenge phase and the conflict is described in the <chapref>Missions</chapref> chapter.
<h2>Advance and Recover</h2>
Each hero that went on the mission may take one skill advance in any desired skill. Additionally they may mark one season of progress on a consequence box. This works the same as it does during downtime training.
<h2>Remove Stress</h2>
After the mission is over, all stress is removed. Consequences hang around and must be removed via downtime.
<h2>Mission Results</h2>
Every mission has repercussions for the Stronghold. The Stronghold sheet and chronicle of trade are updated to reflect these changes at the conclusion of the mission. Notes may be made on the chronicle of seasons in order to remember important details, such as stability or region loss, or notable consequences taken by important characters. The details of how to resolve each type of mission are given in the <chapref>Missions</chapref> chapter and the different conflict chapters.
For threats, it’s important to note that failing a threat is different than ignoring a threat. The repercussions for ignoring a threat were applied earlier before Stronghold upkeep. Usually, failing a Threat isn’t as bad as ignoring it completely.
<h1>Determine New Threats and Schemes</h1>
After the mission is over, the spotlight player checks for region threats and ally threats. The Autarch player decides if they would like to reveal a scheme. The differences between the threats and schemes are described in more detail in the <chapref>Threats and Schemes</chapref> chapter. Note that none of the checks to see if a threat occurs are skill checks, so fate points may not be spent to alter them. Before checking for threats, reshuffle all of the cards.
<h2>Region Threats</h2>
Region threats are disruptions and problems with a region the Stronghold controls, potentially causing issues with gathering resources as well as draining Stronghold stability. For each region the Stronghold controls, draw a card (or roll the dice). If the result is +3 or +4, there is a threat in the region. To determine the details of the region threat, including difficulty and the type of conflict needed to resolve it, roll on the Region Threats chart in the <chapref>Threats and Schemes</chapref> chapter.
<h2>Faction Threats</h2>
Faction threats are potential sources of strife from factions. Ignoring them lowers the disposition of the minor faction, damaging the relationship. For each minor faction, draw a card (or roll the dice). If the result is a +3 or +4, there is a faction threat with that minor faction.
If the faction is an ally (they have a disposition of -1 or higher), check on the Faction Threats chart in the <chapref>Threats and Schemes</chapref> chapter to determine the difficulty and type of conflict needed to resolve it. If the faction is an enemy (-2 disposition or lower), the Autarch player chooses the type of conflict.
<h2>Autarch Schemes</h2>
Finally, there are potential schemes from the Autarch that may be revealed. Each year, the Autarch player may reveal two schemes. At this time, the Autarch player decides if they would like to use a scheme, and if so, which track to advance.
See the <chapref>Threats and Schemes</chapref> chapter for available options. If a scheme is chosen, update the chronicle of trade to show the current Empire mission difficulties and scheme levels.
<h1>Next Mission</h1>
The final activity of the season is planning what mission should be undertaken next. The spotlight player resolves any disagreements. If this is done at the end of the evening, it helps the group plan for next session. It may also be useful to resolve over e-mail or some other medium to allow for more involved discussions.
