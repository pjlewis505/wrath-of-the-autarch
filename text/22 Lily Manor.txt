<chapter>Lily Manor</chapter>
Lily Manor is the hub of culture, science, and trade throughout the Realm. Rather than protect themselves with military might, the people of Lily Manor protect themselves with secrets. Secrets gained by embedding agents in every nook and cranny throughout the world. These secrets form powerful deterrents to invasion.
It is good for the people of Lily Manor that they command the reluctant aid of other factions, as they hold a level of wealth and opulence only rivaled by the Autarch. This is gained through shrewd and aggressive trading with every other faction, even venturing into the Gravewood.
Besides wealth and trade, science and knowledge are highly prized within the borders of Lily Manor. They preciously guard vaults of lore detailing the practices and peoples of the world around them.
Lily Manor is rules by a small number of provincial leaders, the speakers, chosen from among the population every year during the longest night of the winter. These positions are open to anyone cutthroat enough to engage in the sorts of byzantine political maneuvering necessary for success.
Sex and love aren’t closely related for the people of Lily Manor. Most people, even those in somewhat committed relationships, tend to have multiple sexual partners from various walks of life. While pronouncements of love are very rare, and reflect honor and a certain measure of trust more than a physical bond.

</missionentry>
One of Zarrah’s chief rivals is Crow Manor, a house with rapidly growing influence. This influence is due mainly to the help of the Sapphire Djinn. A generation ago, the Sapphire Djinn hid from a necromancer that was chasing it by possessing the farmhand Arwa. Even better for the Djinn, Arwa was pregnant with quadruplets. The Djinn passed through to the quadruplets, and used them as vessels to carry out its desires.
The Sapphire Djinn enjoys harassing humans that have power, and bargaining for tribute from the vessels willing to do the dirty work. The Sapphire Djinn guided the decisions of Arwa’s children, and helped them grow into charismatic leaders who pose a major threat to Zarrah’s power. Zarrah is aware that a djinn is behind the success of Crow Manor, but is unable to use magical means to stop the spirit. Zarrah realizes that the heroes may have more success bargaining for the djinn’s services, simultaneously giving the Stronghold an ally, and removing an irritating threat to her rule.

<h2>Setup</h2>
Use all four descendents of Arwa, if necessary balancing the sides by limiting actions for the larger side as described in the Diplomacy chapter. A good theme for issues is trust. The Sapphire Djinn wants.?
<h2>Sample Issues</h2>
<list>
Working too close with Zarrah
Will to topple the Autarch
A fear of the arcane arts
The value of freedom
The future of Crow Manor
</list>
<h2>Resolution</h2>
The heroes need to successfully address three of the five issues in order to gain the support of the Sapphire Djinn. Any unaddressed issues become campaign aspects for the Autarch Player, with one free invoke each.
<h2>The Sapphire Djinn</h2>
If they gain the djinn’s support, it inhabits one of the heroes. The hero must change one aspect to reflect this new power. At the start of and mission including the hero, the djinn may use its vast knowledge to aid the heroes. The heroes start with one mission aspect with two free invokes. Furthermore, in diplomacy missions with the hero, the Stronghold players may place two influence on any issues before the conflict starts.
