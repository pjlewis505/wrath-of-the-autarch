<chapter>Battle Plans</chapter>?
Even during a time of war, the Autarch watches your settlement with a keen eye toward teaching you a painful lesson. It was years ago that you gathered the people up from under her nose and traveled beyond the dark mountains, looking to start a new life. Old grudges die hard, and catching the cloaked Freetrader within your village confirmed your worst fears; when the Empire is finished conquering the Gray Plains, you’re next.
And there is no longer any question of <i>if</i> the Gray City-State will fall. It will fall very soon, allowing the Autarch’s troops to begin the long trek back. Perhaps a few years yet before the threats begin in earnest, before the Empire’s thirst for expansion brings attackers beyond the mountains toward your stronghold, but no more than that. You have a dearth of time to prepare for the Autarch’s wrath. Will you use that time to build up a military force to stop her? Use diplomacy and convince the scattered factions around you to unite for a common cause? Or will you ignore the great risks, and harness the power of the arcane arts? What will you sacrifice for independence?
<h1>The Wrath of the Autarch</h1>
The <book>Wrath of the Autarch (WotA)</book> is a kingdom building game. Players collaborate to tell the story of a small group of leaders trying to guide a settlement through trials and tribulations within a fantastic realm. The central character of this story is the <term>Stronghold</term>, a society of people struggling to survive in the shadow of The Empire of the Autarch. The Stronghold will hopefully grow over many seasons into a powerful force capable of withstanding the onslaught of the Autarch, but it will require strategy and luck.?
More than just telling stories, though, <book>WotA</book> is also a game. One player controls the Empire of the Autarch along with any other opposition which threatens the Stronghold. The other players control the Stronghold. The Stronghold players strategize and plan the best course of action to thwart the Autarch. The Autarch player tries to bring about the destruction of the Stronghold by using increasingly powerful threats.?
<book>WotA</book> is played over a number of sessions each taking about three hours to complete. A session focuses on one season of time for the Stronghold. Each season, one important Stronghold effort, called a <term>mission</term>, is played out in more detail. Missions link together to form a campaign. The campaign ends has thwarted the Autarch or succumbed to her wrath.?
Over the course of the campaign the Empire’s power grows. The Autarch works feverishly to draw magical energy from the Animaelic Forest, channeling the dreams there into powerful sorceries. and the Empire gains resources from the exploitation of the Gray Plains. If the Stronghold isn’t successful after six years, the Autarch is able to fully harness the power of the Animaelic forest, becoming an unstoppable force.
<h2>Band of Heroes</h2>?
Stronghold players do not play the role of only one character for the duration of the campaign. Instead, a pool of ten Stronghold <term>heroes</term> are created at campaign start. At the beginning of each session of play, each Stronghold player chooses a character from this pool, based on the hero’s suitability for the mission at hand.?
For instance, if the mission involves killing an ogre that is stealing cattle, choosing heroes more suitable for combat would be wise. Managing these heroes is an important part of the game, as they are not easily recovered if something unfortunate occurs. If enough heroes are killed or taken out of action for lengthy periods of time, it may become difficult to successfully complete missions and hold off the Autarch.?
<h2>Characters</h2>?
All of the characters in <book>WotA</book> are described by five concepts; <term>aspects</term>, <term>skills</term>, <term>stunts</term>, <term>stress</term>, and <term>consequences</term>. Aspects are the most important part of any game derived from <book>Fate Core</book>. These are short descriptive phrases which give both color and mechanical weight to characters, relationships, factions, regions, and scenes. For instance, <aspect>Towering Swordsmith</aspect> and <aspect>Quick to Anger</aspect> could be aspects associated with a character. Aspects are described in more detail in the <chapref>Core Rules</chapref> chapter.?
Skills are broad areas of capability that describe what a character is good at. Stunts are associated with skills and are abilities that go above and beyond what the common person is capable of.?
Stress and consequences reflect different forms of hardship the character is experiencing. There are two main stress tracks, <term>mental</term> and <term>physical</term>. Mental stress could range from psychological trauma to lack of dedication for the mission at hand. Physical stress tends to represent exhaustion and strain. There are consequences (represented as aspects) associated with these stress tracks. While stress is very transient, consequences could be longer lasting: more harmful psychological issues or raw physical trauma. See the <chapref>Core Rules</chapref> chapter for more.?
<h2>The Stronghold</h2>?
The Stronghold is the centerpiece of the game. The term <i>Stronghold</i> is used as a generic way to refer to the society which all of the heroes will inhabit (the players will come up with a specific and evocative name for their particular Stronghold). During the initial session of the game, details about the Stronghold will be fleshed out. Why was the Stronghold founded? What sort of grudge exists between the Autarch and the Stronghold? What are the values of the people within the Stronghold?
The attributes which describe the Stronghold are <term>stability</term> and <term>dispositions</term> with other factions. These are numeric values ranging from -6 to +6. Stability describes the overall health of the Stronghold. If stability decreases too far, it becomes more and more difficult for the heroes to succeed at missions. This reflects unrest and low morale within the Stronghold. Dispositions are tracked between the Stronghold and the other five minor factions in the game. A positive disposition indicates an alliance, while a negative disposition indicates an adversarial relationship. Very high disposition additionally means the faction will provide troops in wartime situations, while a very low disposition means the faction will aid the Autarch.
The Stronghold also has <term>developments</term> and <term>regions</term>. Developments are improved capabilities for the Stronghold. They are similar to stunts, although they affect all the heroes from the Stronghold rather than just one. For instance, a mage tower provides all the heroes with improved magical might. Regions are large areas of land, which provide resources for trading or building developments. The resources in the game are <term>food</term>, <term>timber</term>, <term>ore</term>, <term>mana</term>, and <term>luxuries</term>.?
<h1>The Land of Six Winters</h1>?
The setting for Wrath of the Autarch is a medieval fantasy world known as Six Winters. Besides The Empire of the Autarch, there are five minor factions which play an important part in the ongoing struggle between the Autarch and the Stronghold. Each faction has different strengths and weaknesses. Becoming allies with a complementary faction is important.
Although each faction has a few key details to help everyone get into the setting, this isn't a worldbook with a fully fleshed out history. The players will collaborate every session to fill in the starting skeleton and make the world their own.
<h2>Geography</h2>
There is no set world map or fixed geography. The factions, like the Stronghold, also have regions, although the exact location of regions is left ambiguous. There are also unexplored regions, each with different sorts of goods and features, which the Stronghold may be able to expand into and settle.?
<h2>The Land is Alive</h2>
Magic in the Six Winters is a primeval force which links the land and the people together. The raw substrate is referred to as mana, and is harnessed by channelers, people and creatures attuned to its presence. Mana is present everywhere, but in some regions, old and mysterious places in the Realm, it exists in a high enough concentration that it can be used to create powerful effects. Magic is powerful, but also chaotic and dangerous, potentially <term>backlashing</term> and blighting the land.?
<h2>The Autarch</h2>
The Autarch is the most important character in the game. She is a sorcerer of great power and a shrewd leader. The Autarch rules over a sprawling empire, known internally as the Independent Free Guilds, whose populace are referred to as Freetraders. Outsiders refer to the Autarch’s kingdom as the Empire.
At the start of the campaign, the players work together to come up with a motivation for the conflict between the Autarch and the Stronghold. The Empire may just pursue relentless expansion, or there could be a more personal reason. Perhaps the heroes of the Stronghold are military defectors or political dissidents. For whatever reason, there is a great threat from the Autarch which the Stronghold will need to deal with. Initially, the Autarch is fighting a battle against a numerous, but somewhat primitive peoples far away. This conflict provides the Stronghold a few years of relative calm before the Autarch can attack in earnest.
The Empire has a stability attribute like the Stronghold, which plays a role in how effective they are in pursuing their goals. The Autarch player doesn't harvest resources and build developments in the same way as the Stronghold. Instead, a few different <term>threat levels</term> are used to track offensive and defensive capability in four broad areas. These threat levels grow each year, allowing the Autarch player to formulate their own strategy to stop the Stronghold.
<h2>Minor Factions</h2>
The five minor factions also have stability and regions similar to the Empire. For the minor factions, these capabilities tend to be very static and unchanging over the campaign. Each minor faction also has various sorts of resources they import and export. Trade relations with minor factions forms an important part of the long term strategy for the Stronghold. Each minor faction has their own chapter which describes in more detail the important leaders and abilities they possess. The minor factions are
<list>
<b>Burgan Vale—</b>The people of the Vale live in a balance with the land, taking only what they need. Some of the most powerful mages in the Realm reside here.?
<b>Crescent Hold—</b>Amongst the cliffs and canyons of Crescent Hold are massive fortresses made of stone and steel. The culture of Crescent Hold is stratified like the layers of rock they inhabit.
<b>Lily Manor—</b>A cosmopolitan trade hub, the leaders of Lily Manor are experts at getting maximum value from the exquisite fineries they have on offer. All manner of pleasures and goods are on offer in their marble pleasure domes.
<b>Gravewood—</b>Gravewood is withdrawn and isolated from the world. The people carve out a difficult life in a dangerous part of the Realm that not many care to visit. Their independence is guarded both by isolation as well as by learning and leveraging secrets from other factions.
<b>The Sunriders—</b>The Sunriders are loosely assembled clans that roam the land on great golden destriers from whence their name comes. The Sunriders guard and protect large swathes of farmland which they use for both feeding the population and trading for mana.
</list>?
<h1>Missions</h1>?
Each season the Stronghold players choose one mission to undertake. There are seven mission types in <i>WotA</i>. Each mission has different effects on the Stronghold and possibly other factions in the Realm. Ultimately, there are only so many significant efforts which can be accomplished during a year, and each mission will need to be prioritized between the immediate and long term needs of the Stronghold. The mission types are
<list>
<b>Alliance—</b>Alliance missions strengthen relationships with other minor factions. Friendlier allies mean better trade, access to quests, and possibly the pledge of military aid.?
<b>Conquest—</b>Conquest is the process of claiming regions for the Stronghold. This could be from expanding into unexplored regions or conquering regions via military force.?
<b>Sabotage—</b>Successful sabotage lowers a faction’s stability and hobbles their effectiveness against other sorts of missions. This is particularly useful against the Empire.?
<b>Assassination—</b>Murdering a faction’s leader is a grim but possibly effective way to render them ineffective against certain mission types. Assassinating the Autarch is a (not very easy) way to win the game.
<b>Heist—</b>Heists are a way to gain additional resources for a season. They’re best used to steal high value resources, like luxuries.
<b>Quest—</b>Quests are expeditions to retrieve powerful relics and artifacts. Quests are difficult undertakings with substantial rewards. Rumors of quests must be found through alliances with minor factions.
<b>Threat—</b>Threats are problems that can occur in regions or with minor factions. Threats are determined by chance at the end of each session. Threats can be ignored, but there are consequences for the Stronghold.
<b>Scheme—</b>Schemes are the machinations of the Empire of the Autarch. As the campaign continues on, schemes become more dire and punishing. Unlike threats, these are not determined by chance, but are rather chosen by the Autarch player.
</list>
<h2>Mission Structure</h2>
Missions are composed of two distinct modes of play, a <term>challenge phase</term> followed by a <term>conflict</term>. During the challenge phase, the heroes are confronted by tasks and hardships referred to as <term>challenges</term> which they must overcome. The challenge phase is also a time for players to use certain stunts and skills proactively, in order to give the heroes advantages later on in the campaign. The challenge phase is fast moving and relies on the creativity of all the players to create scenes.
After the challenge phase comes a conflict, a set of tactical rules designed around a specific theme. The type of conflict depends on the current mission. Where the challenges are very simple and open for any situation, the conflicts provide a framework that allows for more strategy during play. Although each conflict has a different flavor, they’re organized around similar rules and principles to make the game more cohesive. The conflict types are
<list>
<b>Diplomacy—</b>Persuade influential members of another faction.
<b>Infiltration—</b>Use stealth and secrecy to achieve an objective inside a physical target.
<b>Skirmish—</b>Battle small numbers of opponents.
<b>Warfare—</b>Large scale military action involving the raising of troops.
</list>
<h1>How to Proceed</h1>?
It is neither necessary, nor even wise, to read the entire book before playing. The most important pieces of information are placed in the first few chapters. The <chapref>Core Rules</chapref>, <chapref>Missions</chapref>, and <chapref>Challenge Phase</chapref> chapters contain the core of the game. Everything is built from these concepts. The <chapref>Getting Started</chapref> chapter includes information on the first session and how to start playing. Read these chapters before attempting play. The rest of the book should be read as needed over the course of the campaign.??
