<h1>Core Rules</h1>

<l2s>Spend a fate point (or free invoke) to <b>invoke</b> an aspect and gain +2 or re-draw</l2s>
<l2s>May use one <b>helpful</b> aspect (assets and relationships) on skill check, draw a card and add suns to the skill check</l2s>
<l2s>May use one <b>hindering</b> aspect (assets and relationships) on skill check, draw a card and subtract moons, gain a skill advance</l2s>
<l1s>Core Actions</l1s>
<l2s><fate>c</fate> <b>create advantage - </b>Create an aspect with a free invocation</l2s>
<l2s><fate>o</fate> <b>overcome - </b>Remove an aspect or accomplish a general goal</l2s>
<l2s><fate>a</fate> <b>attack - </b>Target takes stress equal to shifts</l2s>
<l3s><b>Important</b> May not inflict more stress than skill used to attack with</l3s>
<l2s><fate>d</fate> <b>defend - </b>A response to attack or overcome actions</l2s>
<l1s>Stress for Success (Heroes Only)</l1s>
<l2s>Apply stress cards to add to check (each card adds +2)</l2s>
<l3s>Max two cards</l3s>
<l3s>Each sun results in one physical stress and each moon in one mental stress</l3s>
<l3s>All cards must be drawn at the same time, adding all symbols together and taking all stress at once</l3s>
<l1s>Challenge Phase</l1s>
<l2s><b>Create Advantage - </b>Mission and campaign aspects may be created during challenge phase (and only during challenge phase)</l2s>
<l3s><b>Minor Advantage: </b>Mission difficulty - 2</l3s>
<l3s><b>Mission Aspect: </b>Mission difficulty</l3s>
<l3s><b>Campaign Aspect: </b>Mission difficulty + 2 (make sure there is an open slot on the Stronghold sheet)</l3s>
<l2s><b>Resolve Challenge (Overcome) - </b>On success, challenge is resolved</l2s>
<l3s>If there are suns, characters in scene take stress. Character taking resolve challenge action takes one stress for each sun on challenge, all other characters in scene take one stress (players taking stress decide how to allocate it)</l3s>
<l3s>Moons must be removed first using a Resolve Challenge action with an opposition equal to the number of moons (time)</l3s>
<l3s><b>Failure - </b>Challenge is failed and removed, Autarch player creates a mission aspect with one free invoke</l3s>
<l2s>When a hero’s opposition for creating advantages or resolving challenges is higher than skill rank, gain a <b>skill advance</b></l2s>
<l2s><b>Complication (Autarch Player) - </b>If accepted, draw card and add suns and moons to challenge</l2s>
<l2s>Each <b>ignored challenge</b> gives the Autarch player a number of fate points equal to the number of players for the conflict</l2s>
<l1s>Conflicts</l1s>
<l2s>Autarch player starts with one fate point for each hero</l2s>
<l2s>No skill advances during the conflict</l2s>
<l1s>Magic</l1s>
<l2s>Spellcasters start each session with mana equal to their Channeling plus the mana of the bound region</l2s>
<l2s><b>Backlash: </b>After using mana, make a Channeling skill check with passive opposition equal to total mana spent</l2s>
<l3s>Lose one resource in bound region for each point below the opposition value</l3s>

<l2s><term>Address Issue (Overcome) - </term>Rapport vs. Wits to address issue (Rapport vs. 0 if no leader is on other side of issue)</l2s>
<l3s>If multiple leaders are on other side of issue, opposing player may choose who defends</l3s>

<l1s>Resolution</l1s>
<l2s>Unless specified elsewhere, if the Stronghold wins three or more issues, they are successful</l2s>
<l2s><b>Alliance Missions: </b>Number of issues won by Stronghold determines disposition gain</l2s>
<l3s>Each unresolved issue becomes a campaign aspect with one free invoke</l3s>
<l3s>0: -2 Disposition, 1: -1 Disposition, 2: No change, 3: +1 Disposition, 4: +2 Disposition, 5: +3 Disposition</l3s>
